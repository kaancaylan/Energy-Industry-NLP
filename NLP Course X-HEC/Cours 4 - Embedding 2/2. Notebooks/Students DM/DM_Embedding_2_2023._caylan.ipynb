The way BERT does sentence classification, is that it adds a token called [CLS] (for classification) at the beginning of every sentence. The output corresponding to that token can be thought of as an embedding for the entire sentence.\n","\n","We'll save those in the features variable, as they'll serve as the features to our logitics regression model.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"y3nPR2mrIUqq"},"outputs":[],"source":["features = last_hidden_states[0][:,0,:].numpy()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"cMOj30SrZOQq","outputId":"4da371bd-65e2-4572-8d66-0d0290d0f0d5"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["((200, 768), 200)"]},"execution_count":44,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["features.shape, len(labels)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"cne1LmgZPyQP"},"source":["## Model 2: Train/Test Split\n","Let's now split our datset into a training set and testing set (even though we're using 1,000 sentences from the reviews training set)."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"-EfDqA84TU_4"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Split the data in train and test with the train_test_split function\n","X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, labels)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"gDc9UFa5P_8G"},"source":["## [Bonus] Grid Search for Parameters\n","We can dive into Logistic regression directly with the Scikit Learn default parameters, but sometimes it's worth searching for the best value of the C parameter, which determines regularization strength."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"Xg1yURnlQDRD","outputId":"86fe94d4-0100-400f-9bd8-9b37cfb3de5f"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Best hyperparameters:  {'C': 0.4}\n","Best score:  0.8533333333333334\n"]}],"source":["from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\n","from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV\n","\n","model = LogisticRegression()\n","param_grid = {'C': [0.01, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 1, 2, 4, 6]}\n","search = GridSearchCV(model, param_grid, cv=3)\n","search.fit(X_train, y_train)\n","\n","print(\"Best hyperparameters: \", search.best_params_)\n","print(\"Best score: \", search.best_score_)\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"J39zQKd7QLqw"},"source":["We now train the LogisticRegression model.
