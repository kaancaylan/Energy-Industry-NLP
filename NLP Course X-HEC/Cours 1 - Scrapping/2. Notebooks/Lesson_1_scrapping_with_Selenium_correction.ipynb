In particular, here are some points to know:\n","\n","> * **HTML elements:** an HTML document is composed of elements nested within each other. Each element is defined by an opening and closing tag, such as <p> and </p> for a paragraph. Elements can have attributes that define additional properties, such as class or id.\n","> * **The structure of an HTML document:** an HTML document is organized into a set of elements that form a hierarchy. The document has a root, which is the html element, and it can contain two main parts: head and body. The head part contains information about the document, like its title, and the body part contains the content displayed on the screen.\n","> * **CSS selectors:** Selenium uses CSS selectors to find elements on a web page. A CSS selector is a string that allows you to select one or more elements based on their name, class or identifier. For example, the selector \"div.review-card\" selects all div elements that have the class review-card.\n","\n","By knowing these basic HTML concepts, you will be able to understand the structure of a web page and how to select the elements you want with Selenium."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"2ce25620","metadata":{"id":"2ce25620"},"source":["## 1.
